# Web Browser Template

This repository is where all code for the homework will be contained.

When code is pushed to this repository github Actions will automatically run 
  the tests for the week's homework.
The tester will import `web_browser.py` and test the required functions.
Details on the test system can be found 
[here](https://github.com/utah-cs4962-fa21/tests).

Do not modify anything the the `.github` directory.
