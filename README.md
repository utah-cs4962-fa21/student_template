# Web Browser Template

This repository is where all your code for the homeworks should be contained.

When code is pushed to this repository
  [Github  Actions][gha] will automatically run
  [the tests][tests] for the week's homework.
For that to work, you must have a `browser.py` file
  that exports all of the expected functions and classes.
You donâ€™t have to put all of your code into one file,
  but all of your classes and methods should be exported from this file.
The easiest way to do that is to add from `other_file import *` at the top.

Details on the testing system can be found in [its repository][tests].

[gha]: https://github.com/features/actions
[tests]: https://github.com/utah-cs4962-fa21/tests

Do not modify anything the the `.github` directory,
  which configures Github Actions to run the tester.
