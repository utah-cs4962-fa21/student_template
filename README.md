# Web Browser Template

This repository is where all code for the homework will be contained.

When code is pushed to this repository github 
  [Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) will automatically run the 
  tests for the week's homework.
The tester will import `browser.py` and test the required functions.
You donâ€™t have to put all of your code into one file, but all of your classes
  and methods should be exported from this file.
The easiest way to do that is to add from `other_file import *` at the top.
Details on the testing system can be found 
[here](https://github.com/utah-cs4962-fa21/tests).

Do not modify anything the the `.github` directory, as this is what tells 
  Actions how to run the tester.
